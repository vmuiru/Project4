# Bespoke News

Curate the news YOU want to see! Keep your thoughts and opinions organized on each article you collect.

## &#x1f4a1; Motivation

After researching your typical news media application, we saw that there was a lack of cross-platform news gathering. We 
wanted to give the everyday user the ability to add their own article and look up your favorite article from top publications.

## Version 1.0
